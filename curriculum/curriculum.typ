    == Gasparini Srl - Backend & frontend developer, researcher
    _Internship, from November 2022 to April 2023_
  ]

  I worked on Daphne (a project about monitoring forests with smart sensors), developing a backend
  from scratch with AWS, Serverless and Node. I also developed a frontend, with _JavaScript+Svelte_, to
  view and label data.

  I worked again on the Zephyrus framework: a major rewrite with ZeroMQ instead of ROS improved
  build time of 10000% and delay of 100000%. It's still adopted in over 10 company projects.

  I designed and coded a framework called Zephyrus. Based on ROS and Docker, Zephyrus automates build, run e debug of distributed programs, as the ones used in company robots. 

  I was also involved in the making process of a Sealion ROUV (underwater drone) prototype.

    == University of Padova - Information Engineering, 110/110 Cum Laude
    _Bachelor Degree, from October 2018 to September 2021_
  ]

  I chose the traditional University of Padova career: a bachelor degree with exams about computer science, maths, physics, electronics and telecommunications + a master degree focused on computer science only. 
  
  #underline("Bachelor Thesys"): I suggested and developed Unyw, an hybrid app for running desktop Linux binaries on Android, with a brand new system to remap native GUIs into web pages.
